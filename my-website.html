          <p>I am Dr. Pedro Viadanna, a veterinarian passionate about fish health, wildlife conservation, and the integration of aquatic animal health into the broader One Health framework. My research focuses on understanding and managing diseases in fish and amphibians, especially those with implications for biodiversity and ecosystem balance.</p>
          <p>I have over 15 years of experience in aquatic animal health, diagnostics, and research. I am dedicated to building collaborations that improve our ability to prevent, detect, and mitigate the impacts of aquatic diseases across farmed and wild populations.</p>
          <p>My goal is to support sustainable aquaculture and healthy ecosystems through science-based approaches, education, and outreach.</p>

          <p>The Fish and Wildlife Disease Lab is a multidisciplinary team of researchers, graduate students, and collaborators working to understand disease dynamics in aquatic systems. We combine laboratory, field, and computational approaches to study emerging pathogens and their impacts on fish and wildlife health.</p>
          <p>Our group values collaboration, mentorship, and scientific integrity. We strive to train the next generation of scientists and resource managers who can tackle complex challenges at the interface of aquatic health, conservation, and sustainability.</p>

          <p>I am deeply committed to teaching and mentoring students in aquatic animal health, fish pathology, and One Health. My teaching philosophy is centered on critical thinking, hands-on learning, and linking theoretical knowledge to real-world applications.</p>
          <p>Courses I have taught and contributed to include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fish Health and Disease Diagnostics</li>
            <li>Aquatic Pathobiology</li>
